# generatepassword

In this repository I have created a password generator that allows the user to generate a random password using a number of choices by the user. The user can chose whether or not they want their password to contain lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. The user can also chose the length of their password bettween 8 and 128 characters.
